# LazAndroidOrmDemo
A Lazarus Android mORMot example.
The backend database uses MariaDB ï¼ŒAndroid client is developed using laz4android1.6 + mORMot .
The intermediate services layer is developed using laz4android1.6 + mORMot + ZeosDBO.
This example is based on an android application that has been running for 2.5 years. The image data uploaded in the background has exceeded 60G and is still running normally.
Now I'm going to open source it.
